## Core Principles

1. **Ephemeral-First**: Data is temporary by default, with explicit persistence policies
2. **Self-Healing**: Automatic failure detection and recovery without human intervention
3. **Intelligent Placement**: Data flows to optimal storage tiers based on usage patterns
4. **Zero-Configuration**: Nodes auto-discover and self-organize into clusters
5. **Computational Focus**: Optimized for short-lived, high-throughput computational workloads
