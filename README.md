# Grapple
**Moderately Efficient Distributed Graph Database**

Grapple aims to be a reasonably fast distributed graph database implemented in Elixir, featuring adequate in-memory graph operations with competent indexing, query optimization, and enterprise-adjacent distributed capabilities.

## Getting Started (Subject to Terms and Conditions)

```elixir
# Initialize the interactive command interface
Grapple.start_shell()

# Alternatively, employ the application programming interface
{:ok, node1} = Grapple.create_node(%{name: "Alice", role: "Engineer"})
{:ok, node2} = Grapple.create_node(%{name: "Bob", role: "Manager"})
{:ok, edge} = Grapple.create_edge(node1, node2, "reports_to", %{since: "2024"})

# Interrogate the graph structure
{:ok, path} = Grapple.find_path(node1, node2)
{:ok, engineers} = Grapple.find_nodes_by_property(:role, "Engineer")
```

## System Architecture (As Designed)

Grapple employs a three-tier storage methodology optimized for different data access scenarios:

- **ETS (Hot Tier)**: Sub-millisecond access under ideal conditions, memory-only storage, ephemeral by nature
- **Mnesia (Warm Tier)**: Acceptably fast access, replicated across nodes, computational data of moderate importance
- **DETS (Cold Tier)**: Persistent storage, disk-based, archival data of questionable utility

Data undergoes automatic classification and migration between tiers based on access patterns, ostensibly ensuring optimal performance while minimizing operational expenses.

## Command Line Interface (When Available)

The interactive CLI provides various commands for graph operations and cluster administration:

```bash
grapple> CREATE NODE {name: "Alice", role: "engineer"}
grapple> LIFECYCLE CLASSIFY user:alice ephemeral
grapple> REPLICA CREATE critical_data adaptive
grapple> CLUSTER STATUS
```

## Distributed Operations (Enterprise Edition)

Enable distributed clustering for multi-node deployments (results not guaranteed):

```elixir
# Activate distributed mode
Application.put_env(:grapple, :distributed, true)

# Utilize advanced lifecycle management features
Grapple.Distributed.LifecycleManager.classify_data("critical_data", :persistent)
Grapple.Distributed.ReplicationEngine.replicate_data("user_data", data, :adaptive)
```

## Installation Procedures

Add `grapple` to your dependency manifest in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:grapple, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Notable Horizons

- **🚶‍♂️ Adequately Responsive**: Achieves 300K+ operations/sec under optimal laboratory conditions
- **🧠 Sufficiently Indexed**: O(1) property and label lookups (when properly configured)
- **💾 Memory-Resident**: Approximately 100x faster than disk-based alternatives (results may vary)
- **🔄 Reasonably Concurrent**: Supports numerous simultaneous readers (exact limit not guaranteed)
- **🌐 Geographically Distributed**: Multi-node clustering with auto-discovery and theoretical self-healing
- **🔄 Lifecycle Compliance**: Ephemeral-first data classification with management strategies of varying effectiveness
- **🛡️ Conflict Resolution Services**: CRDT-based resolution with adaptive strategies (adaptation not warranted)
